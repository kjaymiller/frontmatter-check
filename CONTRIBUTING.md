# Contributing

## For all Contributors

### When in doubt, file an issue

Issues are a great way to let me know that things are not as you think they should be. If you are unsure of a behavior, please file an issue.

### If you want to work on something say so and wait for it to be assigned

This isn't my primary project, which means that I may not get to adding that feature that you really wish. I'm happy for your to make a contribution. So that others know that it is currently being worked on, please comment your intent to work on it and wait for me or another maintainer to assign the task to you.

### Your PR description should tell the whole story

We don't use a template because it drives people to do the bare minimum.

WE WILL NOT MERGE YOUR PR IF YOU DON'T EXPLAIN WHAT YOU ARE ACCOMPLISHING.

Any file changes that don't seem like they need to be in the PR either explain why they are there or remove them.

### PRs shouldn't contain multiple issues

The only exception is when an issues references other issues and those issues are required to complete the issue.

## For Maintainers

### First to comment is the winner

Occasionally people will want to contribute around the same time. The first to request is ultimately who should be assigned. That said, it's encouraged that people work together on things where it makes sense.
